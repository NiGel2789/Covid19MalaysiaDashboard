# Malaysia Active Covid-19 Clusters Data Dashboard
An interactive web-based data dashboard to automatically visualize Covid-19 active cluster data from Malaysia's Ministry of Health (MoH) on a daily basis. Practice for me to be comfortable with the data-centered tools offered in the Google Workspace.

# Technologies Used
Powered by Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and Google Data Studio.

# Features
• Calculation of total cases, total active cases, and total recoveries based on nationwide Covid-19 cluster data.

• Day-by-day breakdown of cases from that cluster, including total cases, and total active cases reported.

• Clear line graph showcasing the 7-day trend of active cases in the selected cluster (or overall).

• Geospatial visualization of clusters on an embedded Google Maps window.

• Automatic data updates from MoH at 1am MYT (GMT+8) daily
